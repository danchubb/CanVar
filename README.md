# CanVar
Framework based upon ExAC to provide study specific variant frequencies. Dependencies and installation instructions are the same as ExAC and are described in https://github.com/konradjk/exac_browser/blob/master/README.md

The code provided here is primarily used to produce the sites VCF file and coverage file required by the framework. Other scripts have been modified to remove hardcoded references to ExAC and the populations contained within it, replacing them with arbitrary groups such as disease state.
